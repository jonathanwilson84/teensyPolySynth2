# teensyPolySynth2
An advancement in my exploration of synthesis using the teensy audio library. 


The code here currently is a mess! It works, but you will have to figure out the button and encoder pins, as well as the screen pins. 

Features:

- 2 op FM and subtractive synth with 20 different waveforms to choose from
- independent envelopes for the oscillator, mod, and the filter
- controlled by 4 rotary encoder with readout on oled screen
- patch saving and loading capabilities (works, but needs work)
- white and pink noise that has its own filter and envelope

Goals:

Clean up the code
Add naming ability for patches
explore additional functionality
Putting together a build guide, as I think this is a pretty cool project. 

If anyone wants to build this and has questions, shoot me a message. I would love some help with the code if anyone is interested.
